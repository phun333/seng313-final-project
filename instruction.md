⚠️ No Excuses, No Exceptions

Claims like "I didn’t read," "I didn’t know," "I didn’t see," or similar excuses will not be
accepted.

All rules in this document are final, and no exceptions will be made.

**1. Academic Integrity Policy**

⚠️ Strict Penalty for Plagiarism

Copy-Pasting Code from ChatGPT, GitHub, or Similar Sources Will Result in Serious
Penalties.

All submitted codes will be thoroughly reviewed and checked for originality using
advanced plagiarism detection tools.

**Penalty: Up to a 100% reduction in score and possible failure of the entire
project.**

**2. Submission Policy**

**Mandatory Submission Rule** : ONLY the Group Leader must submit the final project
files.

Individual Submissions of group members Will Not Be Accepted.

File Naming Convention:

Report File (PDF):

EEE301_FinalProject_GroupLeaderID_GroupLeaderName.pdf

Report and Code Files All Together (Compressed Folder):

EEE301_FinalProject_Code_GroupLeaderID_GroupLeaderName.zip


**3. General Report Instructions**
1. Maximum Length: The project report must not exceed 10 pages (excluding cover
page and references).
2. Document Format: Accepted Format: **PDF ONLY**

Not Accepted: Word documents or other file formats.

**3. Cover Page Requirements:**

Mandatory Information:

```
 Project Title
 Student Name(s) & ID(s) (All group members must be listed)
 Course Name & Instructor Name
```
⚠️ **Missing cover page details will result in penalty points.**

**4. Group Work Guidelines**
1. Group Size Limit:

Maximum Group Size: 4 students at most per group

Minimum Group Size: 2 students (if applicable, if not individual works will be
accepted)

**Before start to do your final project you have to define and tell me this
situation on MS Teams.**

2. Responsibility Sharing:

Each member must actively participate in the project.

3. Penalty for Imbalance:

If a team member fails to contribute, the group leader must notify the instructor
before submission to avoid equal grade distribution.

**5. Report Structure Guidelines**
1. Content Restrictions:

Coding Content: DO NOT include code snippets or code explanations in the report.

Penalty: I DON’T give any points for code in the report, besides this might result in
penalty points.

2. Detailed Complexity Analysis:

**Mandatory Requirement:** Perform detailed complexity analysis of all implemented
algorithms.


**Include** : Time Complexity (Big-O, Omega, Theta): Theoretical analysis of worst,
average, and best-case scenarios.

Space Complexity: Memory usage details.

3. Visual Graphs & Interpretation:

**Graphs Are Mandatory** : Show actual algorithm performance through graphs (e.g.,
time vs input size, space vs input size).

**Labeling** : All graphs must be clearly labeled and referenced in the explanation text.

4. Interpretation & Discussion:

Provide detailed explanations of what the graphs represent.

Compare theoretical complexity with observed performance and explain any
differences.

Missing graphs, incorrect labels, or incomplete interpretations will result in penalties.

**5. Report Sections:**

Introduction (problem description and project scope)

Algorithm Design & Complexity Analysis (detailed analysis with labeled graphs)

Results & Findings (interpretation of graphs and comparisons)

Conclusion & Recommendations (suggest improvements or optimizations).

**6. Code Submission Guidelines**
1. File Format:

Submit your code as a compressed file (.zip or .rar).

2. Code Organization:

Use meaningful file names and ensure the code is well-organized.

**Commenting Requirement:**

Include detailed comments within the code explaining its functionality.

Coding Explanations must be within the code files, not the report.
