# SENG 313 – FINAL PROJECT QUESTIONS

**Question 1: Divide and Conquer**

**Problem:** You are working as a data analyst for an e-commerce platform. Your task is to optimize the
product listing by sorting products based on sales volume and user ratings. Implement and compare
Merge Sort and Quick Sort algorithms to sort a dataset of product records.

**Input Format:**

- A dataset of product records containing product IDs, sales volumes, and average user ratings.

**Expected Output:**

- Sorted product list based on sales volume and ratings.
- Execution time comparison for input sizes of 1000, 5000, and 10,000 records.

**Deliverables:**

- Code implementation
- Execution time comparison table
- Complexity analysis

**Question 2: Greedy Algorithm**

**Problem:** You are a project manager organizing conference sessions. Each session has a fixed start and
end time, and no two sessions can overlap. Implement a task scheduling algorithm using a greedy
approach to schedule the maximum number of non-overlapping sessions.

**Input Format:**

- A list of conference sessions with their start and finish times.

**Expected Output:**

- List of selected sessions maximizing the number of scheduled events.

**Deliverables:**

- Code implementation
- Example test cases with results
- Explanation of the greedy choice property applied

**Question 3: Dynamic Programming**

**Problem:** You are developing a plagiarism detection tool for a publishing house. Implement a Longest
Common Subsequence (LCS) algorithm to compare two text documents and identify matching
sequences. Extend your implementation to output **all possible matching sequences** in case of multiple
results.

**Input Format:**

- Two text documents as input strings.

**Expected Output:**

- Length and content of the longest matching text sequences.
- All possible matching sequences if there are multiple results.

**Deliverables:**

- Code implementation
- Example input/output with detailed explanation
- Complexity analysis (time and space)

**Question 4: Graph Algorithm**

**Problem:** You are building a navigation system for a delivery service. Implement Dijkstra’s algorithm to
find the shortest delivery routes in a city represented as a graph. Extend the system to support **dynamic
route updates** , such as adding or removing roads during runtime.

**Input Format:**

- A city graph represented by an adjacency list or matrix.
- Start location specified by the user.

**Expected Output:**

- Shortest delivery routes from the start location to all other delivery points.
- Updated routes after dynamic changes (e.g., road closures or newly added roads).
- Visualization of the routes (optional for extra credit).

**Deliverables:**

- Code implementation
- Example input/output for city graphs
- Explanation of algorithm steps and complexity analysis

**Question 5: Graph Algorithm**

**Problem:** You are working as a network engineer optimizing internet traffic through a data center.
Implement the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm to calculate the maximum network flow from a source node to a
target node.

**Input Format:**

- A network represented as a directed graph with edge capacities.
- Source and target nodes specified by the user.

**Expected Output:**

- Maximum flow value and paths contributing to the maximum flow.
- Visualization of flow through the network (optional for extra credit).

**Deliverables:**

- Code implementation
- Example input/output for network graphs
- Complexity analysis
